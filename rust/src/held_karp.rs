// Exact solver for the Traveling Salesman Problem with the Held-Karp algorithm.
// See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Held%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm
//
// Essentially, we compute g(S, e), "what's the shortest path from vertex 1
// going through a subset S of vertices, then going to e", starting with |S|=1
// (direct cost from 1 to v, then v to e), we can get the next size by trying
// every possible new second-to-last vertex and picking the smallest.
//
// The final TSP solution starting at '1' is the g(S, i) for the 'i' that gives
// the smallest distance.

// TODO: implement
