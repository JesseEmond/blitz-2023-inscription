The following is a description of the challenge and how I approached it. For
code structure documentation, jump to the end.

### üö© Challenge

For this challenge, we are a salesperson that controls a boat and we want to
visit as many unique ports as possible, as fast as possible, to get the highest
score.

This is a tick-based game, where every tick our bot receives information about
the map and must send the action that our boat will take. We are told we have
1 second maximum per tick to return our action.

#### Details ‚ÑπÔ∏è
The **map** related information contains the following:

- Dimensions: width/height for the tiles of the map;
- Topology: each tile has a given height and, for a given tick, we can only
  navigate _to or from_ a tile if it is _below_ the water (see tide);
- Tide schedule: tells us how high the water currently is for the current tick,
  as well as what it will be like in the next few ticks;
- Ports: the list of port locations that we can visit to score points.

In practice, we see the following characteristics:
- Maps are 50x50 or 60x60, randomly generated;
- Tide schedules are of length 10;
- Tide schedules **cycle**, meaning that we have perfect game information on the
  first tick;
- We see a mix of 14, 16, 18, or 20 ports, with randomness;
- Games are max 400 ticks.

Note that this means that the navigable tiles are dynamic based on the tide and
that shortest paths can depend on the offset within the tide schedule.

We must give our **action**, out of the following:
- Sail: move in any of the 8 directions (up/down/left/right + diagonals), with
  diagonals having the _same cost_ as horizontal/vertical movements;
- Spawn: only do this once at the start;
- Dock: must be done after reaching a port to count it as visited;
- Anchor: wait and do nothing.

Visually, the game looks like this:

#### Scoring üßÆ
The game ends if we dock the first port again (do a full tour) or if 400 ticks
are reached. Then, the score is computed based on the following formula:

```
bonus = 2 if ports_visited[0] == ports_visited[-1] else 1
base = len(ports_visited) * 125 - 3 * total_ticks
score = base * bonus
```

In simpler terms: visit many ports quickly, try to loop back home.

The example above visited 19 ports in 274 ticks, doing a full tour. This gave a
score of 3106 points:

```
bonus = 2  # full loop
base = 19 * 125 - 3 * 274 = 1553
score = 1553 * 2 = 3106
```

Based on the scoring formula, we see that:
- Looping is almost always desired (doubles score + ends game early). Hard to
  imagine cases where visiting `n` ports and forcing 400 ticks total without a
  loop would be better than looping back after `n/2` ports and being able to end
  early;
- Higher number of ports can score us more points. While theoretically games of
  lower ports can match games of higher ones (e.g. 3896 pts can be achieved with
  a 20 ports loop in 184 ticks, the same can be obtained if it would be possible
  to get a 17 ports map, in a 17 ports loop in 59 ticks -- which would be an
  extremely lucky & packed map), our best bet is with a 20-ports game.

#### Roll the Dice üé≤
The randomness of some of the parameters (map generation, tide, # ports) leads
to the optimal possible score on a game depending on luck, and can vary quite a
bit between games.

Here are two games side-by-side with 20 ports that lead to very different
optimal scores (3422 points in 263 ticks vs. 3734 points in 211 ticks), even
though they both visit 20 ports (the optimal solver will be described later):

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1843555/202344987-9ca0679c-5819-477a-9ae1-03f6531ca394.mp4

To give an idea of the range, here is the distribution of optimal scores for 100
20-port games assigned to us by the server:

![optimal score distribution](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1843555/202337764-ce9662e0-ff0a-424e-9349-cf21eefa25da.png)

Note that this is showing the optimal score, too (best case scenario), and that
we have a 1-second time limit to reply to each tick, which might not allow us to
run an optimal solver. However, this does show that there's a good amount of
variability across games and if we want to get a high score on the leaderboard,
we'll have to roll the dice and rerun games for a chance at a high score towards
the right of this distribution.

### ü§ë Greedy Solver

I started off in Python, and with a simple bot: start on the first port in the
list, then go to the next one in a straight line, disregarding tides. This
allowed me to get used to the challenge & its API, get a score on the board
early so Marc doesn't pull my leg too much, and to design a bot API with:
- "micro" control with a simple state machine that can follow a fixed path by
sending `Sail` actions with the right directions, and `Dock` once the goal is
reached;
- "macro" control to pick goals and give paths (for now visit ports in the
arbitrary input order and generate straight line paths).

As you can imagine, there's no guarantee that a straight line works depending
on the topology, so this would often give a very negative score from getting
to 400 ticks with almost no ports visited. I even got a ping from Andy saying
"I didn't know it went this far into the negatives" after a -575 points game,
shortly after a -950 points one.

Next, I implemented `A*` starting off from the [fantastic pathfinding resource
at Red Blob Games](https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/implementation.html)
(newer version of the `Amit's A* pages`). For the heuristic, I used the
[Chebyshev distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_distance) (which
is essentially `max(deltax, deltay)`) to account for diagonal movements of
cost 1. My pathfinding implementation for now ignored tide changes, assuming
that the tide was always at its lowest (most restrictive), meaning that all
tiles that are navigable at that point are _always_ navigable. This restricts
our truly optimal pathfinding opportunities, but gives us correct paths in
the positive points range!

### ü§ñ Local Server

Making changes, uploading the code to the server, waiting for a game to run,
then downloading the logs to iterate is quite a long feedback loop to find
trivial bugs. I pivoted to implementing my own version of the server that can
run locally, from game data that I had logged in my previous games on the
server.

This is something that really would have made more sense to do as a very
first step, but hey, I wanted _something_ on the
leaderboard. :slightly_smiling_face:

I made sure that my bot running against my local server on historical games
gave the same score as it did on the server, and it took some iterations to
iron out the exact ordering of operations executed on the server for
movements and tide updates. Eventually though, I ended with a much faster
feedback loop.

### üß≠ Nearest Neighbor Solver

Following the input port list blindly (spawn on the first one, go to the
next, etc.) is not a good strategy -- we end up needlessly taking very
long paths when we could visit some ports along the way.

Instead, we can prioritize the next unvisited port with the shortest
distance. On the
[Traveling Salesperson Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem),
this is essentially the
[nearest neighbour algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbour_algorithm).

To find the shortest path to _any_ goals (the closest unvisited port),
I changed my `A*` implementation to early exit if any position in a
list of goals is found, instead of a single position.

Additionally, since our ports might not all be reachable from each other
(since we're doing `A*` assuming the lowest possible tide), we also
simulate this strategy for each possible starting point, to pick which
spawning position would give the best score. This idea is also
beneficial if we take tides into account -- some starting positions
might be better than others because they start us in a favorable tide
point in the schedule.

As part of this planning/simulation, I also consider the option of
"going home" (back to the first port) early in the search (vs.
continuing to the rest of the ports), since it can sometimes be best to
end the game earlier vs. visit more ports for the amount of ticks
needed to get there.

### üåä Pathfinding With Tides

Assuming the lowest tide is fairly restrictive, we might instead
unlock shortcuts when the tide is high if we time our movements right.

To adjust pathfinding to take into account tides, we can change
the neighbor generation in `A*` to dynamically lookup tiles that
are navigable with the tide for the current tick offset. This current
tide value can be found by looking up
`tide_schedule[tick % len(tide_schedule)]` (since it cycles), by using
the `A*` `g` score as the `tick` value (the cost so far).

Then, we also want to allow our boat to "wait" for a tick (send
an `anchor` action) in case we can take advantage of a
tide change in the next few ticks. To do so, we change our `A*`
like this:
- The state we push in the priority queue is no longer just a
  position on the grid, it is now a tuple `(position, wait)`,
  where "wait" is the amount of ticks we have waited for so far.
- When adding `A*` neighbors:
  - Add horizontal/vertical/diagonal move actions as
    `(new_position, 0)` with cost 1;
  - Add "wait" actions as `(position, wait+1)` with cost 1;
  - Only add "wait" sometimes: do not bother waiting more than
    `len(tide_schedule)` ticks, there's no point since it cycles
    after thant;
  - Only add "move" sometimes: do not consider move actions if
    we are on an unnavigable tile (e.g. we waited and the tide
    went down), we are not allowed to move then.

With this, we start getting a boat that moves efficiently
between ports and takes some pretty cool shortcuts!

_Note that diagonal movements of cost 1 are visually
unintuitive -- it often takes paths that look slower, but are
equivalent to going in straight lines. I didn't do anything to
avoid
[ugly paths](https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/implementation.html#troubleshooting-ugly-path)._

### üï∏Ô∏è Building a Graph

When we get the game information on the first tick, we can
precompute all of the following at once:
- For each port, shortest path to all other ports;
- Do that for each possible tick offset in the tide schedule.

The reason for doing so is that we can then create a graph
from our ports:
- Each port is a **vertex**;
- Each port connects to other ports via a precomputed shortest
  path -- that's an **edge**;
- The **cost** of this edge (and the exact path details)
  depends on the tick offset we are at on the source vertex.

But this gets expensive: 10 tick offsets, 20 vertices,
190 edges (fully connected graph), that's 1900 total shortest
paths if we do them pairwise. If we want to fit this in 1
second and do processing on that graph afterwards, we need
to speed things up:
- I rewrote the bot in Rust;
- I changed my `A*` implementation to support finding the
  shortest paths to _all_ targets at once, instead of the
  closest one:
  - Switch the heuristic to the smallest
    [Chebyshev distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_distance)
    in the list of remaining ports;
  - When a goal is found, we remove it from the remainder
    list and reprioritize the priority queue with updated
    heuristic values;
- I did a couple more optimizations, outlined in the
  `Speech Optimization Ablation` section.
